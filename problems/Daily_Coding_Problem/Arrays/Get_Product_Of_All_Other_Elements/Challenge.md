# Get Product Of All Other Elements
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index $i$ of the new array is the product of all numbers in the original array except the one at $i$.

For example, if the input was $\left[1, 2, 3, 4 \right]$, the expected output would be $\left[120, 60, 40, 30, 24\right]. If the input was $\left[3, 2, 1 \right]$, the expected output is $\left[2, 3, 6\right]$.

**Level 2 is to do it without division!**
