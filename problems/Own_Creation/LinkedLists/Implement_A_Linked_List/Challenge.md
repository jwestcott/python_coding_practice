# Implement a basic Singularly Linked List

Implement a basic singularly Linked List in Python. The Linked List should ultimately expose the same API as the Python list (as detailed [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_list.asp)) with some differences.
For now, do not implement the list slicing that is available to lists in Python. Instead implement a ```get(n)``` method which will allow you to access the ```n```'th element in the list.

The challenge could be approached in the following stages:
1. Implement the ```append()``` and ```count()``` methods for the Linked List.
2. Implement the ```get(n)``` method for getting the ```n```'th object from the Linked List.
3. Implement the ```insert()``` and ```remove()``` methods.
4. Implement the ```index()``` method.
5. Implement the ```pop()``` method.
6. Provide iteration support (so that the Linked List can be used with for loops).
