# Python Coding Practice
This repository is intended to be a store for problems and solutions to various programming challenges.
All scripts should be Python 3.X compatible, and no modules other than those already included in the Python 3 distribution are allowed (although it is preferable if none of these are used!).
A full list of these modules can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html).
